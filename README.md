# Overview

This Flashcard App was created to help me grow as a software engineer by learning how to build interactive mobile applications using React Native and Expo Router. My goal was to understand how to manage user input, share state across components, and handle navigation in a multi-screen app.

The app allows users to create their own flashcard sets by entering questions and answers. Users can then study these flashcards by flipping them one at a time to view the answer, and cycle through their set in order. I tried to build a separate screen that also allows users to manage their flashcardsâ€”editing or deleting them if needed however it isn't fully working.

This project helped me gain experience with core app-building concepts such as forms, dynamic navigation, shared context, and component-based design.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Expo Go (for mobile testing)
- Git & GitHub for version control

# Technologies Used

- React Native with Expo
- Expo Router for navigation
- TypeScript
- Context API for shared flashcard data
- React Native components (e.g., View, Text, TextInput, Button)
